# MQTT minimal Example


For run this code, you must set the values of the connection, and run it into the command line passing the mode 'sub' to suscribe or 'pub' to publish.

In two cases you must set only the clientID
 in this format 
 ```
 ./main mode clientID
 ````

 Note:
  This is a only minimal example of how MQTT works on golang
